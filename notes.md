## Notes 

##  Design Choices
- Built with Expo + React Native for cross-platform support.  
- Focused on speech recognition and text response display.  
- UI kept minimal — one button for starting/stopping listening.  
- Used Expo’s managed workflow for easy setup and permissions handling.

##  Third-Party Packages Used
- expo-speech — for text-to-speech  
- expo-av — for audio playback  
- react-native-paper — for UI components  
- react-native-web — for running on web
